1. Spike the program : -  find out loophole 


start vulnserver !  
connect with nc with second side

type HELP 

run commands with generaic _start_tcp  and creacker spk file 

then attack on the other side check the crash !

-----------------------------

covert entire process in python again fuzz it with using trun and socket 

----------------------------

then create pattern to get start address of eip 

----------------------------

then get value with pattern offset --  and try to get exect EIP offset value for buffer

--------------------------------

then try to execute shellcode with eip  to come to know what are things that are supported in the attack  

check hexdump from esp with right click 

remove bogus 

download mona modules from github and paste into pycommands in immunity 

use !mona modules to use this module and find out our program to verifiy the protections

so our program is not having any protection so

now we need to a jum esp  so start nasm_shell.rb  
# execute !mona find -s "\xff\xe4 -m essfunc.dll
#625011af  

shell = "A" * 2003 + "\xaf\x11\x50\62 


#coz of litten endian formet we need to add these address into it the shell

#now after execution search the address into immunity and make sure you get jmp esp and set a break point on it to stop the program for our purpos
